    %p Okay, so I shouldn't put a heading here at the beginnging of the body because pelican is going to parse the title from the <em>head</em> tag; I then use the title to create an H1 in front of this body content.
    %p And here's another paragraph.
    %section
      %h2 This is a section
      %p And the text for that section! Voila!
      %code{"data-gist-id" => "1b9deaa419f61bfe6a77", "data-gist-file" => "package.json"}
    %p Very nice.
