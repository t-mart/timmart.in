  <h2>Is this my site?</h2>
  <time datetime="2014-11-09T07:06:08-05:00">Nov 9, 2014</time>
  <p>In reading <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2014/oct/06/http-considered-unethical/">Alex Gaynor’s post prodding for more
HTTPS</a>, I was
ecstatic to learn I could start serving my site with a free certificate from
<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl">CloudFlare</a>. <em>I’ve set this up already;
be sure to <a href="https://timmart.in">check it out</a>.</em></p>

<p>Not only was I interested in the details of implementing a certificate on my
site (however, CloudFlare abstracts that away pretty magically), but I
also had been wanting to publish my PGP key in case anyone wanted to talk
about super secret stuff. I jest, but I think it’s kinda cool.</p>

<p>A while ago, I had my PGP key published on an unsecured site of mine. A
friend quickly told me this was a problem: Without
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a> in
place, the content on my site, including a PGP key, is not guaranteed to
have:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Confidentiality</dt>
  <dd>secrecy of the content from other parties, like ISPs, employers, etc.</dd>
  <dt>Message Integrity</dt>
  <dd>the content is intact and has not been modified.</dd>
  <dt>Authenticity&#42;</dt>
  <dd>the content was delivered from me/on my behalf.</dd>
</dl>

<p>But I have all that now with a certificate in place. So I can publish my
PGP key and security-conscious users can rest assured they’re getting the key
they <em>think</em> they’re getting?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>I tricked you a little bit here because I didn’t tell you about CloudFlare’s
identity verification process: There is none for the certificate I use here.
That means there’s no provable link between this site and me, the breathing
human being Tim Martin with a reputation to uphold. Hence, this compromises the
aforementioned <strong>authenticity*</strong>.</p>

<p>As of right now, the only way to prove authenticity is for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">Certificate
Authority</a> to perform an
identity check, the details of which are (only) guidelined by the CA/Browser Forum in
a document like
<a href="https://cabforum.org/wp-content/uploads/EV-V1_5_2Libre.pdf">this</a>. Further,
this check is only performed on applications for a different class of
certificates known as <em>Extended Validation Certificates</em> (which generally cost
considerably more), and this certificate is not one of them.</p>

<p>(There are a lot of theoretical flaws and profit-centric motives in the CA
scheme that accompany practically any notion of trust on the web. Some of
these flaws have been acted upon. You should do some Wikipedia-ing on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">the</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate">matter</a> if
you’re unfamiliar.)</p>

<p>Anyway, you can check for yourself that this certificate has nothing really to
do with me, and that my identity has not been verified. Take a look at this
screenshot of Chrome’s Certificate dialog:</p>

<figcaption>See that <code>sni74477.cloudflaressl.com</code>? That's not
me.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, yes, you have confidentiality, you have message integrity, but the only
thing you know about authenticity is that this content comes from CloudFlare.</p>
